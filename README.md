# Average-Path-Length-to-a-Random-Node-in-a-BST
Empirical studies to compute the average and standard deviation of the average length of a path to random node (internal path length divided bye tree size,plus 1) in  a BST built by insertion of N random keys into an initially empty tree,for N from 100 to 10,000.1000 trials for each tree size to increase precision.Plotted the result in a Tufte plot,fit with a curve plotting the function 1.39 logN - 1.85.
